# Welder

Welder is a lightweight webservice intended to be run on Dataproc Clusters and GCE VMs spun up by [Leonardo](https://github.com/DataBiosphere/leonardo). Compute spun up by Leonardo allows users to run interactive tools, such as Jupyter, in the cloud. Welder's primary purpose is to facilitate the persistence of files generated by these tools to a bucket in Google Cloud Storage. See the API section below for a list of endpoints and functions available in Welder.
